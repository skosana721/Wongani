## Introduction

I will share about how the day was and also talk about edit functionality which was something that I had a problem with express

## Body

So I say would say that the freecodecamp section where it has to do with quality assurance and testing with Chai so I can be able to do it but the problem is that I don't understand it that much because freecodecamp is not explaining in details why are we suppose use whatever they so we are supposed to use the only thing that they give you is a short brief on what you are supposed to use but they do not explain in more detail for you to fully know why it necessary to use what they have given you. I would say that for me to understand the quality assurance and testing with Chai better is to do research and show tutorial on it to fully understand the why on things.

And for the edit functionality, I would say that it has been hard for me to do before and the reason I think would be that I did not understand fully what was required when creating an edit function. So now understand it just a little bit and what I know is that for you to edit anything you need to target the element you want to edit with its id and after targeting the element with its id you selected the value that you want to change and also an input for edit should be created for you to be able to grip the value you want to target.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, so what I have learned when it comes to editing a value is that in coding if you don't understand what you are given it would be hard for you to find the solution even if you try to research them because what's important is to understand the problem at hand before attempting to code but what I have seen from my side is that sometimes I am quick to try and solve a problem without fully understanding what is what I am supposed to do.

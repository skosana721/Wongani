## Introduction

I will share about solving the problem that I had with the replit which is an online IDE that freecodecamp chose for their backend challenges and the problem had to do with replit not being able to read the variable in the 'sample.env' file. so the app was not able to connect to MongoDB.

## Body

So to find the solution to the problem I clone the 'freecodecamp/boilerplate-advance node repo from GitHub to my machine and in my, GitHub created a new repo called 'advance-node-express' and did some changes in the freecodecamp repo using the 'Set up a Template Engine' challenge and push the change to the 'advance-node-express' repo and ran the server locally using vs code. And so the link that I do use for the test was 'http://localhost:8080/'

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this was slow down my progress in the freecodecamp and I could not do it without showing some youtube videos on setup the freecodecamp repo with vs code.

## Introduction

I will share what I was doing during the day and some of the problem that I had with editing and complete functionality.

## Body

So when it comes to the editing I would say that I can kinder do it in the frontend but for me to do it took a lot of trial and error because I think it took me about one to two in the morning to find what kinder works so for me do it I created a form which had only one input for input capture the current value which I want to edit and created state for an edit which initial I pass progress which was a value that I wanted to edit in the table. And created a function of handleEdit which takes an id as a parameter and edit to and declare a variable of currentProgress and used the find method to find the object that had the same id as the id from the parameter and created an if statement that checks if the selectedEmployee is true which is a variable and if it is I assign the progress which is in the selectedEmployee to the currentProgress and outside the if statement I an assign the edit parameter to it and return an object with currentProgress and id. And created a function for the complete which this function is responsible for className of complete if it true and the complete className add styling to the selected object which draws line-through the text in the table where I map my data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, being able to kinder do the edit functionality gave me a good feeling because I have been struggling for about two days so being able to understand the flow of the do it was a good feeling so What is left for me to be able to create a put request in the express and also do it for the complete functionality because it only works in the frontend for now.

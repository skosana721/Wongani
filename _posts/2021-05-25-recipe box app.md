I will share the recipe box application that Moral gave us to do

## Body

So the recipe box app is a mern stack application that does create, read, update and delete. So the app has input field for recipe name and textarea for the ingredients that are required to make that recipe and data is saved to mongoDB when adding and is displayed in a form of a list and the data that is displayed is retrieve mongDB when the get request is made in the frontend. And the whole recipe can be deleted and also edit the ingredients if you made a mistake and you have failed to mention set ingredients when you were add the recipe.

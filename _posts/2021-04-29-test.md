## Introduction

I will share about the test that we were writing today and share things that I had easy and some of the things that I found tricky to do.

## Body

For the react program that we were supposed to create a function that calculated the exponent of any given number and display using recursion. So I would say that using recursion is not something that I understand that well because if the test was not an open book I would not have been able to do it, because I do not understand recursion that well. But I was able to do the program regardless simply because of using google as a guide to solving the problems that I had.

And for the second react program that we had to create a program that takes an input of numbers and the output to be if a number in string is odd an underscore which adds after two odd numbers. So I would say that creating a program that adds underscore was not that difficult because I understood what was required of me and I did not use any googling on that one because on this one I broke it to pieces so that I was able to better understand how to start solving.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would say think the tests we are being given at TCG are helpful in a way that they show us where you need to put more effect on which is something good because you know your strength and weakness as a developer.

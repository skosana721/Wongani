## Introduction

I will share about a kata called count of positives /sum of negatives

## Body

In this kata you are gave an array which has mixture of positive and negative number. so you should count the number of positive numbers in the array and sum all the negative numbers in the array and return an array, where the first element is the count of positive numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. If the input array is empty or null, return an array.

So to solve this I created an variable for positiveCount which initial is zero and another variable for negativeSum which initial is zero and add an if statement that checks if the array is not equal to null , and also if not the array length is greater than zero and if that is true I looped through the array and in the for loop add an if statement that checks in the current number in the loop is greater than zero and if that is true increment positiveCount by 1 and else add current number in the loop negativeSum and return the positiveCount and negativeSum in an array and if the condition that wraps the whole logic not is false return an empty array.

## Conclusion

In conclusion,

## Introduction

I will share about my day

## Body

So today I had a meeting at 2pm with Tanilla and Moral where I was given feedback on the assignment that I was given some weeks ago on wireframes, pseudo, user story and database design.

So the feedback was positive because Tanilla said beside the database structure I was pretty confident with these topics and I am suppose to expand on this work and challenge myself.

When it comes to the wireframe I was suppose to add bit more details and that I should not confuse between 'sing up' and 'sign in' on my sign in form. Regarding the user story I should alway keep mind the the 'who','what','why' when write my user story. Where the 'who' is the person we are building this for, 'what' describes the their intent - not the features they use, and 'why' is the overall benefit they're trying to achieve.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I learned about low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes which low-fidelity is paper-based and does not allow user interaction and high-fidelity has to do with you doing wireframes on a computer. And regarding database design that is where I need to improve more because the are certain concepts that I do not know.

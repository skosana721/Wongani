## Introduction

I will share about my day

## Body

So today I had a meeting at 2 pm with Tanilla and Moral where I was given feedback on the assignment that I was given some weeks ago on wireframes, pseudo, user story and database design.

So the feedback was positive because Tanilla said besides the database structure I was pretty confident with these topics and I am supposed to expand on this work and challenge myself.

When it comes to the wireframe I was supposed to add a bit more details and that I should not confuse between 'sign up' and 'sign in' on my sign-in form. Regarding the user story, I should always keep in mind the 'who', 'what', 'why' when write my user story. Where the 'who' is the person we are building this for, 'what' describes their intent - not the features they use, and 'why' is the overall benefit they're trying to achieve.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I learned about low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes which low-fidelity is paper-based and does not allow user interaction and high-fidelity has to do with you doing wireframes on a computer. And regarding database design that is where I need to prove more because the are certain concepts that I do not know.

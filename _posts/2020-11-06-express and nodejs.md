## Introduction 

I will share about the assignment that we were given last week and what I have learned

## Body

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.

The benefits of using Node.js:

- Node is designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).

- The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has a best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.

### What is express?

- Express is the most popular Node web framework and is the underlying library for some other popular Node web frameworks.

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

- Integrate with "view" rendering engines to generate responses by inserting data into templates.

- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.

- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, those two concepts are the ones that would say I understand well regard building a server and some of the concepts when to build a server I would say that I don't understand them that well and this is just a summary.

## Introduction

I will share about the kata that Njabulo and Moral gave us to do which were not that challenging but where good as a learning practice.

## Body

So the first kata had to do with returning a negative regardless of whether the number pass as an argument was a positive or negative number and if zero was pass the function was suppose to return.

### solution

const returnNegative = (num) => {
if (num > 0) {
return 0 - num;
} else if (num < 0) {
return num;
} else {
return 0;
}
};
returnNegative(0);

So I compared the argument to check if the it was greater than 0 and if it was true that number would be subtracted from 0 to return it as a negative number and else if the number was less than 0 I just return that number and else if that number is not greater or less than 0 I just return 0.

And than kata required to create a function that remove letters in an array return number only as it output.

### Solution

let array = ["b ", 3, 98, "c", 2, 5, "eat", 11, 7, "car", "string"];

const removeLetters = (arr) => {
let numberArray = [];
for (let i of arr) {
if (typeof i === "number") {
numberArray.push(i);
}
}
return numberArray;
};
removeLetters(array);

So I created a function called removeLetters which takes a array as a parameter and in that function created a variable called numberArray which initial is empty and used a for loop to loop through the array and created a condition that checks if the typeof current value is strictly equal to the a number if it as it push's is to the numberArray.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this kata's were helpful in kind of a way because I did not allow myself to use high order function but decide to write the logic myself to help me use some of JavaScript method to better understand what they do.

## Introduction

I will share about the activity the Moral gave me to do which I'm required to create a mern stack app which is a to-do list.

## Body

I would say that the frontend part of the app, in my opinion, is not that difficult but the only problem that thinks I would have is in redux where you are doing API with actions because that is something I haven't tried before. So for me to find solutions on how to do API calls with redux I would have to do some research and watch some tutorials to get an understanding of how it works. And I am having some problems when it comes to creating my server so the problem is connecting the dot between what I have learned when I come to express server and MongoDB which I haven't completed the freecodecamp challenges on it. So I was planning that on a weekend I should video regarding express and MongoDB and also some videos which will give clue on how to combine express and MongoDB to create a server.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would say that I was excited when Moral mention that he was giving me an activity that involved building backend and frontend and connects because in my view I see a lot of value in it.

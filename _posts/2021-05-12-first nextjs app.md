## Introduction

I will share about my first attempt at using nextjs to build an application

## Body

So last week I asked Moral to give me some work to do because I wanted something that was a little bit challenging so Moral gave me some work to do which had to do with building a FIFA app which had two input field for the team and the person's name and when they submit their info is displayed on a table where they can also input their team's score and the team with the highest will be displayed on the one the table. So first I wanted to do this react but remembered that Mandla told me to look it nextjs and after learning a bit about it I decided to just try doing it with next.js some that I can better understand it and how it way because for when I would say that I know the only theory.

So far things are not that good because implementing redux is not that simple as I thought it would be like in react. But so far I have seen some advantage of using comes to next.js and that has to do with page routing is built-in so the is no need for an npm package to install and also there is less boilerplate to work with and it has css module ready for you which just makes styling components or pages simple.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would not say thing are that bad with next.js but I would try to do some research on the way next.js handles state and also how to implement redux.

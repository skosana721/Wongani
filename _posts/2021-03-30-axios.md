## Introduction

I will share about the mern stack todo app and some of the challenges that I am having with it. So the problem that I was have was doing a post request with redux.

## Body

So to be able to do this wasn't that hard but problem was that because I simply a bit of understanding when it comes to redux and how the flow of it works but implement some form of fetch API to this was the tricky part about it. So I installed axois which is an npm package, so what Axios is, is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js Axios which makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to a REST endpoint and perform CRUD operations and CRUD is simply an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. So created an actionTypes of ADD_TODOS and created an action for addTodos which takes 'todo' as a parameter and returns dispatch as a function in the dispatch Axios. post and add the path to which the data should be added to which was 'localhost:4000/API/todo and in the post, the method adds the second parameter as an object which I passed todo which will be the data that will be posted to MongoDB every time the addTodos action is dispatched, then the post method returns a response in which I dispatch actionType of ADD_TODOS and has a payload of the response.data which is the data sent.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I have seen that I understand built a simple mern stack app so when I just think that I should just practice on building more mern stack app so that I can become good at it and also it would help me to understand what happens in the server of every app.

## Introduction

I will share about my day

## Body

So I was doing a kata by the name of switch it up which has to do with creating a function that takes in a number as its argument and which those numbers are between 0-9 and should be returned in words.

### Switch statement

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in case that follow the matching case. And every case is separated by 'break' which tell the JavaScript to stop evaluating that case.

In this challenge used the switch statement and as an expression used the parameter name as the expression and matched with the actual number and returned it in words.

### Solution to the kata

function switchItUp(number){
switch(number){
case 1:
return 'One'
break;
case 2:
return 'Two'
break
;
case 3:
return 'Three'
break;
case 4:
return 'Four'
break;
case 5:
return 'Five'
break;
case 6:
return 'Six'
break;
case 7:
return 'Seven'
break;
case 8:
return 'Eight'
break;
case 9:
return 'Nine'
default:
return 'Zero'
}
}

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would in some cases considered the switch statement to be a better choice compared to the if statement simply because the syntax is a little clear for me.

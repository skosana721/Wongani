### Html form

 An HTML form is a section of a document containing form elements. Form elements are various types of input elements,
 such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, labels and so on. The HTML <form> tag is used for
 declaring a form. This tag comes in pairs. The special elements which are called controls are written between opening
 (<form>) and closing (</form>) tags. 

 The following form elements are use to create a form:

 -<input>
 -<button>
 -<textarea>
 -<select>
 -<label>
 -<option>
 -<fieldset>

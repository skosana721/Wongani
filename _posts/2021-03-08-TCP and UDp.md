## Introduction

I share what I have learned regarding TCP and UDP and their advantages and disadvantages.

## Body

### What is the TCP?

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over the network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

### What is the UDP?

UDP stand User Datagram Protocol
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network and it's an alternative to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

### Advantage of using TCP

- It helps you to establish/set up a connection between different types of computers.
- It is reliable
- It supports many routing-protocols.
- Latency for congestion control

### Disadvantage of using TCP

- The speed is slow

### Advantages of using UDP

-Is lightweight in a way that the header only take 8 bytes

- is Connectionless meaning that you don't have to establish a connection for you to start sending data.
- The speed of the UDP is faster

### Disadvantages of using UDP

- UDP mostly like to suffer from packet loss
- lack of congestion control
- unreliable

### Conclusion

In conclusion, HTTP uses the TCP because the transmission and completeness are guaranteed which in turn makes the user experience to be great simple the user will most of the time get the right response.

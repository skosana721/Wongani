## Introduction

I will share about my day

## Body

So today I added a sticky navbar feature when the window.scrollY is great then 0 the navbar should stick to the top as I scroll. And the window.scrollY returns the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically. And added a feature when the screen width is 768px or less the navbar should display a hamburger menu which is for tablets and smartphone screens. And also made the website to be responsive to all screen sizes which was a bit hard because I had to check each screen individually to see if everything in each screen looked the way I wanted it to look like and if not I had to do some adjustments.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, so recreating my website thought me some new things and made me comfortable with responsiveness.

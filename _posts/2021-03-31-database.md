## Introduction

I will share what I have learned so far when it comes to creating a database.

## Body

I would say that the task that Moral gave me about doing a mern stack todo app has made me have a bit of understanding about MongoDB, mongoose, and express. So it has given me a grasp for what is required to build a mern stack app and someone of the thing that I need to work on to improve my knowledge in Javascript. And would like to share about the mongoose model, defining and creating them.

### Models and Schemas in mongoose

Models are constructor which is compiled from Schema definitions. And Schemas are the type of data that you require the user to submit and it defines the document shape within the collection of MongoDB. Schemas are then "compiled" into models using the mongoose.model() method. Once you have a model you can use it to find, create, update, and delete objects of the given type.

### Defining schemas

The code fragment below shows how you might define a simple schema. First, you require() mongoose, then use the Schema constructor to create a new schema instance, defining the various fields inside it in the constructor's object parameter.

const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const todoSchema = new Schema ({
todo: {
type: String,
required: true
}
})

Creating a model

const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const todoSchema = new Schema ({
todo: {
type: String,
required: true
}
})

const todo = mongoose.model('Todo', todoSchema)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I have seen that applying what I have learned in freecodecamp has helped more than just doing the challenges and it has given me a real inset into how it is to do a full-stack application.

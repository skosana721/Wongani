## Introduction

I will share about my week and some of the struggles that I have face and where came to solving them.

## Body

This week was a busy week for me as I was busy with moral activity which required to do some of the thing that I did not know like redux-persist , uploading an image when you submit a form and display it , express server , middleware and useParams.

Some will share a little about useParams .

useParams is a react router hooks which route parameters are parts of the URL that will change based on the object we wan to display. For example,in the work that moral gave us wanted to view information on car id , we would visit the path /confirmationPage/id. The last part of teh URL is the parameter. In react-router, we can select dynamic portion of the URl to e matched by putting a colon (:)before it.

### Example of route with URL parameter

<Route path="/confirmationPage/:id" children={<ConfirmationPage />} />

Created a route path with 'confirmationPage/:id" if the path match a component confirmationPage will be render with the id of the match item.

### Showing the id of the matching item\

 <Link to={`/confirmationPage/${car.id}`}>
    <Button onClick={() => selectCar(car.id)}>
        Interested
    </Button>
</Link>

So used Link react router to path referenced the path of confirmationPage component in the map function and passed the car.id is URL parameter when someone clicks on the "IInterested" button.Every time confirmationPage component renders a unique id will be display on the URL parameter the browser.

## Conclusion

The was a busy one because there was little alot learning new concepts and solving problem so I would say that now I am a little bit confident in my coding skills.

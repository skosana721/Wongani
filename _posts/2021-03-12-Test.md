## Introduction

I will share about the test that we were given.

## Body

The test that we were gave was that hard It was just to refresh on what we know about Javascript. We were given a couple of questions, some of the questions were multiple choice and some we had to create some program that does something. So the question that I remember was to write a program the takes an array [2,3,5 ] and I was required to create a function that multiples the numbers in the array and returns the total. I used reduce method to solve the problem. And the other one was an array [24,8,23,32,5,62] which required the output to be in ascending order and in this problem I used the sort method.

### solution for multiplying the numbers in the array

let x = [2, 3, 5];
let results = x.reduce((acc, curr) => {
acc \*= curr;
return acc;
});

### solution for sorting the numbers in the array

let array = [24, 8, 23, 32, 5, 62];
const result = array.sort((a, b) => a - b);

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am thinking of doing this question again but this time I wanted to use a for loop some that I can better understand the logic and the flow of what the high order function is doing behind the scene.

## Introduction

I will share about the test that we were gave .

## Body

The test that we were gave was that hard It was just to refresh on what we know about Javascript. We were gave some couple of question, some of the question were multiple choice and some we had to create some program which does something. So the question that I remember was to write a program the takes an array [2,3,5 ] and I was required to create a function that multiples the numbers in the array and returns the total.Which I used reduce to solve the problem with. And the other one was an array [24,8,23,32,5,62] which required the output to be in ascending order and in this problem I used sort method .

### solution for the multipling the numbers in the array

let x = [2, 3, 5];
let results = x.reduce((acc, curr) => {
acc \*= curr;
return acc;
});

### solution for the sorting the numbers in the array

let array = [24, 8, 23, 32, 5, 62];
const result = array.sort((a, b) => a - b);

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am think of doing this question again but this time I wanted to use for loop some that I can better understand the logic and the flow of what the high order function are doing behind the scene.

## Introduction

I will share about my day how it was and some of the challenges that I face and the work that I was given by Moral to do.

## Body

So I was doing kata on codewars which had to do with basic Math (Add or Subtract) in the kata you are doing addition and subtraction on a given string and the return value must be a string. So the problem is that the plus and minus in the string are given as words for example "1plus2plus3minus4". In my case, I was able to do it when it had to do with adding only so when it was a mixture of plus and minus I could not do it.

And I also said Moral to give me some work to do because I wanted something that would help me learn something new express and MongoDB and also to test myself that do I understand what I have learned so far.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, so for the kata tomorrow I will try and do some research for some clue on how to approach it and if I don't succeed I will ask maybe Moral or Njabulo for help.

## Introduction

I will share about the problem that I had which had to do with replacing the word 'plus' and 'minus' with their respective symbols and also share about how is my next.js learning going so far.

## Body

So this was a kata that you were given a string like '1plus2plus2minus3' so you were supposed to return the sum of that string. So I used the replace method with regex to replace the words with their respective symbols. The replace method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If the pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.

### Syntax

string.replace(regex, newSubstr)

regex (pattern)

A regex object or literal. The match or matches are replaced with newSubstr.

newSubstr (replacement)

The string that replaces the substring specified by the specified regex parameter.

So I was able to replace the words with the plus and minus signs which turned the string to a math express '1+2+2-3' but don't know where to go from where.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this kata has been difficult but every time I try and solve it I get closer to finding the solution.

## Introduction

I will share some of the things that I was doing through the day and some of the problem that I had encountered regard codewars.

## Body

So for the day I was watching an express tutorial and was testing api request to get data in an array and get data by using the find method to try and match if an object in the array matches the parameter id and if it does return a response a JSON and if-else return a response with status code 404 meaning that the id that was passed does not match any id in the array. And the problem that I have encountered today was a codewars kata which wanted to calculate hourly speed, and the kata has a scenario which says "In John's car the GPS records every s seconds the distance travelled from an origin (distances are measured in an arbitrary but consistent unit)". So to calculate the hourly speed was given a formula:

(3600 \* delta_distance) / s

The function takes two parameters which are seconds which is a constant number and x which is an array of distances travelled from origin. So the problem that I have been having is that I am required to subtract the previous number with the current number which is something that I am finding tricks in my side because I tried every method that I thought would work but didn't work.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, tomorrow I will try to call someone to try to give me a clue as to where maybe I might be doing wrong because today I think I have about an hour or even trying to solve it and also tried to do some to find clue but I could not.

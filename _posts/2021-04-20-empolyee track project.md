## Introduction

I will share about the employee track project that Moral gave us about a week ago and talk about what I have found to be problematic and what I have seen to be easier.

## Body

So doing this app without MongoDB has involved a lot of knowing express and Javascript because in my view from just doing I would say maybe three or two apps involving MongoDB
it is easier to create a schema and just let mongoose do the work for you but when you are not using it, it involves you defining what you want and adding in extra code that it would not to necessary if you used MongoDB but overall it makes you think a little more than you would.

And something that I have learned is rendering style based on a condition which was something that I only theoretically but did not use even on a single day but maybe moving forward I will try to use it but if I find the situation to be necessary. A problem that I ran into was that when I did a post request in the frontend the data that I was trying to push in the employees was not working because inside the req. body there was another object called form which was the form data from my frontend but I did not know till I did a console.log in the app. post route in the backend.

And there is a problem that I have been having which updating/editing this is something that I have been trying to solve and I have done some research and watch a tutorial on youtube about it the problem that I have is not that I can not find videos related to this matter the problem is that I do not understand how it is done so I do not see the point for me to try and implement something I do not understand how it is done.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, so the problem that I had with the post request showed me why the console.log is important when you are a code/developer because it let you see why you do not get the results. And when it comes to the update/edit I will ask Moral to explain it thoroughly to the point where I can understand and after that, I will try and do it myself using the knowledge that I would have gotten from him.

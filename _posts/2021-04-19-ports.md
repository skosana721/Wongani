## Introduction

I will share about the employee tracker app which I have been doing today where the api was not working and when I try to call the api in the frontend it said that the err unsafe port.

## Body

So for me to fix the problem where the api was not responding I called Moral to help me fix it because it was not the first time experiencing this problem but also Moral could not see what was the problem so I just did what I did before which was to delete all the code in the file and rewrite it again to if it would work and it worked but still I try to research what caused the problem but I could not find the answers to what is the problem.

And the problem which had to do with the api not response when I try to do a axois.get in the frontend was just cause but me using a port that is restricted in chrome browser. So here are some restricted ports on chrome :

1, // tcpmux
7, // echo
9, // discard
11, // systat
13, // daytime
15, // netstat
17, // qotd
19, // chargen
20, // ftp data
21, // ftp access
22, // ssh
23, // telnet
25, // smtp
37, // time
42, // name
43, // nicname

103, // gppitnp
104, // acr-nema
109, // pop2
110, // pop3
111, // sunrpc
113, // auth
115, // sftp
117, // uucp-path
119, // nntp
123, // NTP
135, // loc-srv /epmap
139, // netbios
143, // imap2
179, // BGP
389, // ldap

515, // printer
526, // tempo
530, // courier
531, // chat
532, // netnews
540, // uucp
548, // AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)
556, // remotefs
563, // nntp+ssl
587, // stmp?
601, // ??
636, // ldap+ssl
993, // ldap+ssl
995, // pop3+ssl
2049, // nfs
3659, // apple-sasl / PasswordServer
4045, // lockd
6000, // X11
6665, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]
6666, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]
6667, // Standard IRC [Apple addition]
6668, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]
6669, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]
6697, // IRC + TLS

## Conclusion

In conclusion, for some port to restricted is because they could be considered as open proxies are considered quite dangerous. No piece of software should allow itself to be used as an open proxy. It's not so much about Chrome preventing malicious activity, as it is about Chrome ensuring that it is not a hole in an otherwise secured network.

## Introduction

I will share about functional programming and some of the benefits of use it.

## Body

### What is Functional Programming?

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output based on the inputs being taken which, given the same input always results in the same output.

### Benefits of Functional Programming

#### It doesn’t have side-effects and it’s immutable

One of the killer benefits of using Functional Programming is its ability to not show any side-effects in the code. It reduces the likelihood that the code will introduce some bugs since it’s not going to mutate and the bug is easy to spot since it’s within the scope of the function. Once a variable has a value assigned to it, it is no longer subject to change.

#### It’s clean, straightforward, succinct

Functional Programming has always been straightforward so it’s easy to spot some inconsistencies and debug some bugs in the function. In fact, constructing functions are cleaner and easier to maintain than constructing a class as in OOP since you need to think in terms of imperative/procedural pattern such as designing class hierarchies, encapsulation, inheritance, methods, polymorphism.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, function programming is slowly becoming the de-facto standard of building maintainable, robust modern JavaScript applications these days. Lots of generic, reusable utilities that use higher order functions to act on many data types instead of methods that only operate on their colocated data

## Introduction

I will share about the Set object

## Body

### Set

The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.

Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate thorough the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once,; it is uni1ue in the Sets collection

### Constructor

#### Set()

creates a new Set object

#### Static properties

### Instance methods

#### Set.prototype.add(value)

Appends value to the Set object. Returns the Set object with added value.

#### Set.prototype.clear()

Removes all elements from the Set object.

#### Set.prototype.delete(value)

Removes the element associated to the value and returns a boolean asserting whether an element was successfully removed or not. Set.prototype.has(value) will return false afterwards.

#### Set.prototype.has(value)

Returns a boolean asserting whether an element is present with the given value in the Set object or not.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this is something that I did not know till today and can be even used to remove duplicates from array because every value in the set object should be unique.

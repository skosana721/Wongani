## Introduction

I share about session and cookie on the web

## Body

### Session

The session creates a temporary file in a directory on the server where registered session variables and their values are stored. This data is available to all pages on the site while you are still on that site. A session ends when you leave that site or close the browser.

### Cookie

Cookies are text files stored on the client-side and they are kept for use tracking purpose. The server script sends a set of cookies to the browser. The browser keeps the info on a machine for future use. When next time the browser sends any request to the webserver then it sends those cookies information to the server and the server use that information to identify the user.

### Difference between session and cookie

- Cookies stores file in the client-side while session stores files on the server-side
- Session depends on cookies while cookies don't depend on the session
- Cookies have a max size of 4kb while in session you can store as much as you can.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, cookies and Sessions are used to store information. So cookies are only stored on the client-side, while sessions get stored on the client as well as a server.

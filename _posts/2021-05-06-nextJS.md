## Introduction

## Body

### What is Next.js?

Next is a React frontend development web framework created by Vercel (formerly known as Zeit) that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation

### Server-side rendering

Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client, Next.js allows the first-page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO & performance

### SEO

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity of website traffic, as well as exposure to your brand, through non-paid (also known as "organic") search engine results

### Benefits that come with next.js

-Easy page routing
-API routes
-Static site generation
-Easy deployment

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this was a little introduction to the world of next.js and so far would so that I don't understand that well and would try to do research and show tutorial and even create applications with it.

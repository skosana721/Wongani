## Introduction

I share about the work that I have been doing which has to do with the jwt authorization app.

## Body

So I busy the jwt authorization app so today I added validation to the register and login requests with an npm package @hapi/joi. Which I used to validate the req.body to check if the data that is coming from the req.body matches the one in the Schema and created an if statement to handle error for if the password is less than 6 characters, and if the email is invalid.

### Hapi/joi

Hapi/joi is an object schema description language and validator for JavaScript objects. With hapi/joi, we create blueprints or schemas for JavaScript objects (an object that stores information) to ensure the validation of key information.
Hapi is a simple to use the configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching, authentication, and other essential facilities for building web and services applications.

### Hapi/joi installation

npm i @hapi/joi

### validating with @hapi/joi

const registerValidation = (data) => {
const schema = Joi.object({
username: Joi.string().min(6).required(),
email: Joi.string().min(6).required().email(),
password: Joi.string().min(6).required(),
});

return schema.validate(data);
};

## Conclusion

In conclusion, using @hapi/joi made it easy to validate the req.body
based on comparing it with the schema to see if the data we are receiving is the type of data that we want.

## Introduction

I will share about the app that I chose to create.

## Body

Today we were given a choice to create an app of our choice, so I chose to create an analog clock that has a button to toggle to light mode and dark mode. This analog clock app taught about setInterval, getseconds, getminutes, and get hours and also setTimeout.
The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and Worker interfaces, repeatedly call a function or execute a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. It returns an interval ID that uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling clearInterval(). This method is defined by the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin.
The date.getHours() method is used to return the hours from a given Date object. It returns the Hours for the given Date object. Hours is an integer value ranging from 0 to 23.
The date.getMinutes() method is used to fetch the minutes from the given Date object. It returns the minutes for the given Date object. Minutes is an integer value ranging from 0 to 59.
The date.getSeconds() method is used to fetch the seconds from the given Date object. It returns the second for the given date object. Seconds is an integer value ranging from 0 to 59.

## Conclusion 

Today was interesting because there 
was a lot of learning and  I would say even self-evaluation regards my level of understanding when it can to code and I have seen that I need to put more practice in my coding practice because I'm not impressed with my performance.

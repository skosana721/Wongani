## Introduction

I will share about the Javascript presentation that I did today to the first year's

## Body 

The presentation was about data types, variables, functions, for loop, equality operator and if statement, etc.

## Javascript data types:
- String is used to store data such as text.

e.g var Name = 'John'
- Number represents integer and floating number(decimals and exponents)

e.g var number = 2;
   var exponent = 2e2
   var decimal = 2.55

- Boolean is a data type that represents logical entities.

e.g var dataChecked = true
    var loggedIn = false

-undefined data type represents the value that is not assigned
e.g var lastName;
console.log(lastname)

returns undefined

- null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value

e.g var name = null

- object is a complex data type that allows us to store collections of data

e.g var user={
    name: 'John',
    lastName: null,
    age: 32
}

### Function

A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

function greetings (){
    return 'Hello world'
}

-The greetings is a function name
-The parentheses are where you pass the parameters to and if they are many parameters they are separated by commas.
- All the logical statements are enclosed in brackets 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, these are some of the things that I presented about and I learned that there some of the things that I need to learn to strengthen my knowledge in Javascript, So I need to do some reviving.

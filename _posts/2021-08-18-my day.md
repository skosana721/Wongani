## Introduction

I will share What have been doing during the day.

## Body

So I have been busy with my portfolio website so I started it from scratch but currently, the only thing that the website has is just a skeleton of HTML, a bit of css, and a bit of JavaScript. So the reason for changing my whole portfolio website is because I want it to look a bit more modern. And what I did during the day was I did a presentation where I created a simple form with a class-based component and also with react hook. So while doing the class-based component presentation I came across a problem where our app did not want to map items in list array which was in the state. So the way we got the solution is that we called Moral to come and help us, so that moment is when I realise that the reason the app was not mapping was that we were trying to change state directly instead of using the setState function. And the last thing I did was writing user stories for Tanille because she said that I should provide more example of user stories but this time I should write it in the following format: As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by writing my user stories based on the format that Tanille wants, in a way it forces you to design according to what the user wants/needs first before adding some additional features of your own.
